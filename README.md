# Typescript base project developing within a container

This Typescript project demonstrates developing within a Docker container.

The goal: A new developer is able to contribute and create a PR within minutes not days.

To this end the steps are:

- Install Docker Desktop and start
- Clone this repo
- Run a single command to install and run the project in development mode
- Edit, save, commit and push.

Additional benefits include: Common and deterministic development experience. No more, "It works on my machine"

If the developer does not have or want to use `Makefile` they can copy and paste the commands from the makefile into the
terminal
